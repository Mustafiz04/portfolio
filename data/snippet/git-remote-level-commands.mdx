## Clone Intro
Cloning a repository creates a local copy of a remote repository.

<u>Clone a repository:</u>
```
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
<u>Output:</u>
```
Cloning into 'repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 100, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (100/100), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (80/80), done.
Receiving objects: 100% (100/100), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (10/10), done.
```

## Remote Branches
Remote branches are branches in a remote repository, tracked locally.

<u>List remote branches:</u>
```
git branch -r
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/feature-branch
  origin/main
```

## Git Fetching
Fetching downloads objects and refs from another repository.


<u>Fetch updates from remote:</u>
```
git fetch origin
```
<u>Output:</u>
```
From https://github.com/user/repo
 * [new branch]      feature-branch -> origin/feature-branch
```
 
## Git Pulling
Pulling fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

<u>Pull latest changes:</u>

```
git pull origin main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Updating abc123..def456
Fast-forward
 file1.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

## Faking Teamwork
Simulate teamwork by fetching and merging changes from remote.


<u>Fetch and merge changes:</u>

```
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Updating abc123..def456
Fast-forward
 file1.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

```

## Git Pushing
Pushing uploads local branch commits to the remote repository.


<u>Push changes to remote:</u>

```
git push origin main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 298 bytes | 298.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/user/repo.git
   abc123..def456  main -> main
```

## Diverged History
When your branch and remote branch have diverged, you need to integrate changes.

<u>Pull changes before pushing:</u>

```
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Auto-merging file1.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file1.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```


## Locked Main
If the main branch is locked, you might need permissions to push.

<u>Force push (use with caution):</u>

```
git push --force origin main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
To https://github.com/user/repo.git
 + abc123...def456 main -> main (forced update)
```

## Push Main
Push the main branch to the remote repository.

<u>Push main branch:</u>

```
git push origin main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 298 bytes | 298.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/user/repo.git
   abc123..def456  main -> main
```

## Merging with Remotes
Merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch.

<u>Merge remote changes:</u>

```
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Updating abc123..def456
Fast-forward
 file1.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

## Remote Tracking
Remote tracking branches track the state of branches in your remote repositories.

<u>View remote tracking branches:</u>

```
git branch -r
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/feature-branch
  origin/main
```

## Git Push Arguments
Push to a remote repository with specific arguments.

<u>Push a branch:</u>

```
git push origin feature-branch
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 298 bytes | 298.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/user/repo.git
 * [new branch]      feature-branch -> feature-branch
```

##  Git Push Arguments -- Expanded!
Use additional arguments with git push for more control.

<u>Push with force and tags:</u>

```
git push --force --tags origin main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 298 bytes | 298.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/user/repo.git
 + abc123...def456 main -> main (forced update)
 * [new tag]         v1.0 -> v1.0
```










## Fetch Arguments
Use arguments with `git fetch` to limit what is fetched.

<u>Fetch a specific branch:</u>
```
git fetch origin feature-branch
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
From https://github.com/user/repo
 * [new branch]      feature-branch -> origin/feature-branch
```

## Source of Nothing
If nothing changes, fetch will still update refs.

<u>Fetch with no changes:</u>

```
git fetch origin
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
From https://github.com/user/repo
 * [up to date]      main       -> origin/main
```

## Pull Arguments
Use arguments with `git pull` for more control over the process.

<u>Pull with rebase:</u>

```
git pull --rebase origin main
```

<u>Output:</u>
```
From https://github.com/user/repo
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Add new feature
```


These commands provide a robust foundation for working with remote Git repositories, enabling effective collaboration and version control.
