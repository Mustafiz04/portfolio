## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
- **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):** Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing server.
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):** Adding more servers to your pool of resources.

### Load Balancing Strategies
- **Round Robin:** Requests are distributed sequentially.
- **Least Connections:** Requests go to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash:** The client's IP address determines which server receives the request.

## Data Consistency

### CAP Theorem
- **Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
- **Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response.
- **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network between nodes.
*Note: You can only pick two.*

### ACID vs BASE
- **ACID (RDBMS):** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
- **BASE (NoSQL):** Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
- Client waits for a response.
- Good for immediate feedback but can lead to cascading failures.

### Asynchronous (Message Queues, Pub/Sub)
- Client sends a message and continues its work.
- Decouples services and improves system resilience.

## Resiliency Patterns

### Circuit Breaker
Prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services.

### Bulkhead
Isolates elements of an application into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separates read and update operations for a data store.

## Caching Strategies

### Cache-Aside
The application code is responsible for loading data into the cache and keeping it in sync with the database.

### Write-Through
The application writes data to the cache, which then synchronously updates the database.

### Write-Behind (Write-Back)
The application writes data to the cache, and the cache asynchronously updates the database after a delay.
