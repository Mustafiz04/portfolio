A software engineer dedicated to continuous evolution, innovation, and inspiring others through the transformative power of technology.

Currently working as a Software Engineer, primarily on the backend at [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/).

Before joining BitGo, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at [MediBuddy](https://www.medibuddy.in/), a leading healthcare technology platform. There, I developed solutions that improved healthcare access for millions. Prior to that, I contributed to the digital savings account team at [Freecharge](https://freecharge.in/), enhancing user experiences and streamlining financial services.


Outside of the field of software development, I love to travel. I regularly take trips throughout Bangalore to find hidden treasures and experience the local way of life. I find comfort in reading books, and I'm always learning new things about different genres and themes. In addition, I have a strong desire to continue learning throughout my life and am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain new abilities.
