I am a Software Engineer based in Bengaluru, driven by the challenge of building scalable systems and the joy of solving complex problems. With a deep focus on Java and JavaScript ecosystems, I strive to create innovative solutions that make a tangible impact.

Currently, I am a **Senior Software Engineer at [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/)**. My journey in tech has been fueled by a passion for continuous evolution. Previously, I honed my backend skills at **[BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/)**, contributed to democratizing healthcare access at **[MediBuddy](https://www.medibuddy.in/)**, and enhanced digital financial experiences at **[Freecharge](https://www.freecharge.in/)**.

I am particularly drawn to **System Design** and the intricacies of building products that scale. Whether it's optimizing performance or architecting robust services, I enjoy the engineering rigor required to build world-class software.

Beyond the code, I am an explorer at heart. You'll often find me traveling to discover new cultures, capturing moments through **videography**, or simply unwinding with a good book. I also enjoy the strategic depth of **chess**, the immersion of gaming, and the quiet companionship of my feline friends.
