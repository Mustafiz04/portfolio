A software engineer dedicated to continuous evolution, innovation, and inspiring others through the transformative power of technology.

Currently serving as a Software Development Engineer at [MediBuddy](https://www.medibuddy.in/), a leading healthcare technology platform revolutionizing the way individuals access healthcare services. In this role, I am instrumental in developing solutions that enhance access to quality healthcare for millions.

Prior to my tenure at MediBuddy, I honed my skills as a Software Development Engineer at [Freecharge](https://freecharge.in/), where I made significant contributions to the digital savings account team. Through my work, I played a pivotal role in enhancing user experiences and streamlining processes, contributing to the company's mission of providing seamless financial services to its users.

Outside of the field of software development, I love to travel. I regularly take trips throughout Bangalore to find hidden treasures and experience the local way of life. I find comfort in reading books, and I'm always learning new things about different genres and themes. In addition, I have a strong desire to continue learning throughout my life and am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain new abilities.
