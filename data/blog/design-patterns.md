Software engineers need to know low-level design patterns because they offer granular, reusable answers to common programming difficulties in both interviews and real-world situations. Writing effective and maintainable code is demonstrated during an interview by showcasing a candidate's mastery of low-level design patterns, which also demonstrates their grasp of basic object oriented programming concepts. By lowering the likelihood of errors and simplifying future updates, these patterns actually assist engineers in writing code that is clearer, more modular, and scalable. Software developers must therefore become proficient in low-level design patterns in order to succeed in both professional and interview situations.

There are several design patterns, and the most important are categorized into three categories.

## Creational Design Pattern

> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

Design patterns that deal with object creation processes and attempt to construct things in a situation-appropriate way are known as creational design patterns in software engineering. The simplest method of creating objects may lead to additional design complexity or design issues. This issue is resolved by creational design patterns, which in some way regulate the creation of objects.

1. Simple Factory
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. [Singleton](/blog/singleton-design-pattern)
5. Builder
6. Prototype

## Structural Design Pattern

> In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

In software engineering, structural design patterns concentrate on grouping classes and objects into bigger structures. By establishing links between items such as inheritance, composition, and delegation, they aid in the maintenance, scalability, and reuse of code. They improve the flexibility and clarity of the code, which results in higher-quality software and simpler updates.

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Decorator
4. Composite
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

## Behavioral Design Pattern

> In software engineering, behavioral patterns emphasize how objects communicate and collaborate to accomplish tasks efficiently, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns concentrate on how objects interact and cooperate to complete tasks quickly. They offer methods for setting up duties, object interactions, and algorithms. These patterns encourage loose coupling between objects and encapsulate behaviors, which enhances the flexibility, maintainability, and adaptability of the code.

1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Iterator
4. Mediator
5. Memento
6. Observer
7. Visitor
8. Strategy
9. State
10. Template Method
